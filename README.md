Scientific Calculator (Android)

This is a fully functional scientific calculator Android app built with Java and Firebase Realtime Database. It offers both basic and scientific calculation modes with a seamless user experience and persistent history tracking.

⸻

Features

Basic Calculator Mode
	•	Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, decimal input
	•	Includes utility buttons: clear (C), backspace (←), equals (=)
	•	User-friendly layout using GridLayout and ConstraintLayout
	•	Expression evaluation using the exp4j library
	•	Firebase integration to store every calculation

Scientific Calculator Mode
	•	Advanced functions: sin, cos, tan, log, ln, square root, power (^), parentheses, and pi constant
	•	Ability to switch from basic to scientific mode and continue with the same expression
	•	Expression shared between both calculator modes
	•	All calculations performed in scientific mode are also stored in Firebase

Calculation History
	•	BottomSheetDialogFragment used to display a smooth, scrollable history panel
	•	Shared history from both calculator modes
	•	Data fetched live from Firebase Realtime Database

How It Works

Expression Sharing

Expression state is preserved across fragment transitions using a simple static helper class (SharedData). This allows users to start a calculation in basic mode and finish it in scientific mode or vice versa.

History Storage

All calculations are pushed to Firebase under the calculations node. The structure is as follows:

"calculations": {
  "autoGeneratedKey": {
    "expression": "sin(30)+2",
    "result": 2.5
  }
}

This history is shown in a bottom sheet and is accessible from both calculator modes.

Firebase Setup
	1.	Go to Firebase Console and create a new project.
	2.	Add your Android app to the project.
	3.	Download the google-services.json file and place it in your /app folder.
	4.	Ensure Firebase Realtime Database rules allow reading/writing for testing:

{
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true
  }
}

	5.	Add this dependency to your build.gradle (Module) file:

implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-database:20.3.0'



⸻

How to Run
	1.	Clone the repository.
	2.	Open the project in Android Studio.
	3.	Add your Firebase google-services.json file.
	4.	Sync Gradle and run the app on an emulator or physical device.
	5.	Use either mode and access shared history anytime.

Future Improvements
	•	Add a toggle for degrees/radians in scientific mode
	•	Support dark mode and theme customization
	•	Use RecyclerView instead of ListView for better performance and styling
	•	Add Firebase Authentication for user-based history
	•	Implement expression validation and improved error handling
